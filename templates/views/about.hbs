<p>Multivocal is an art and research-based collective. We are concerned with exploring synthesized voices through both practical experiments as well as theoretical reflections. In the collective we strive to combine artistic practice with cultural theory, diversity studies, art history, design and creative programming. We specifically focus on the suspensions that occur when having an exploratory approach in combination with a systematic mode of production and evaluation.</p>
<br>
<p>We explore artistic strategies challenging the notion of character and identity design in synthesized voices. This is unfolded in panel debates, workshops, and artworks </p>
