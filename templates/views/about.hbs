<p>multivocal is an art and research-based collective, concerned with exploring synthesized voices through both practical experiments and theoretical reflections. In this collective we strive to combine artistic practice with cultural theory, diversity studies, art history, design, and creative programming. We specifically focus on the suspensions that occur when having an exploratory approach in combination with systematic modes of production and evaluation.</p>
<br>
<p>We explore artistic strategies, challenging the notion of character and identity design in synthesized voices. This unfolds through panel disucssion, workshops, artworks, and perception testing </p>
