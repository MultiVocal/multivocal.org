    <p>What are the politics and aesthetics of synthesized voices? What happens to our listening experiences of voices when the voice is synthesized? What notions of identity, personhood and will do we ascribe to the synthesized voices talking to us?</p>

    <p>Synthetic voices are artificial voices generated by algorithms in computers. Most of the synthesized voices we hear in our everyday life have one vocal identity. In the project Multivocal we question the aesthetic as well as representational modes of the synthesized voices and ask: since voices from machines are not limited to a single vocal identity, then why do most synthesized voices have only one gender, one age, and one accent?</p>

    <p>The aim of Multivocal is to bring forth reflections of how synthesized voices are affecting us and creating new listening experiences and relationships between humans and machines.</p>
