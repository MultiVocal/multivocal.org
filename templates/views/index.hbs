    <h1>Exploring representation, identity and aesthetics of synthesized voices</h1>
    <p>What are the politics and aesthetics involved in synthesized voices? What happens during the voice listening experiences when the voice we hear is synthesized? What are the notions of identity, personhood and will that we ascribe to the synthesized voices talking to us?</p>

    <p>Synthetic voices are artificial voices generated by algorithms in computers. Most of the synthesized voices we hear in our everyday life have one vocal identity. In multivocal we question the aesthetic as well as representational modes of these  synthesized voices and ask: since voices from machines are not limited to a single vocal identity, then why do most synthesized voices have only one gender, one age, and one accent?</p>

    <p>multivocal aims to produce reflections on the implications that synthesized voices have on us, and creating new listening experiences improving human and machine relationships.</p>
